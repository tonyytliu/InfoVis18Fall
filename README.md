The main file for our visualization is "Project.html"

"RadarChart.js" is for the Z-Star Glyph view (top-right), we implement Z-Star Glyph and corresponding transition and interaction methods based on codes for RadarChart provided by Nadieh Bremer http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/6506614

"BarChart.js" is the JavaScript file for the bar chart view (bottom-left).

"tang_song.json" is the actual file used in information visualization program.
